        <h3>CHINESE ZODIAC</h3>
<p>The movie begins with the story of the Old Summer Palace and its looting and destruction by British and French soldiers in the Second Opium War. Among the artifacts looted are twelve bronze heads of the animals of the Chinese zodiac. In the present day, the bronze heads are auctioned for millions of euros each. The main company supplying the bronze heads and other looted relics is MP Corporation. JC (Jackie Chan) is tasked by MP Corp to find the remaining lost bronze heads, with a promise of a 10x bonus if he can recover all of them. JC visits Professor Guan, who had created 12 identical replicas for study purposes with his team of researchers, under the guise of a reporter named Martin from National Geographic. When left alone, JC scans the multiple bronze Zodiac animal heads using special gloves so that his secret organisation can replicate an extremely realistic model of them. After scanning, he goes to Paris to find a woman named Coco, recommended by Guan, for more information of the whereabouts of two bronze heads.</p>
